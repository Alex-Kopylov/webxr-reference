# XRLayer

The **`XRLayer`** interface of the of the WebXR API defines a source of bitmap images and a description of how the image is to be rendered in the device. Do not use this interface directly. Rather use one of its subtypes. As of the first version of the [WebXR Device API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/) only one subtype, <a href="xrwebgllayer">XRWebGLLayer</a> is supported.
