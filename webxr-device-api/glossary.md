  <dt id="stage">stage</dt>
  <dd>An AR/VR frame of reference that is a bounded, floor-level play space that a user can be expected to safely move within. Some AR/VR platforms refer to this as "room scale", or "standing space".</dd>

  <dt id="viewing-frustum">viewing frustum</dt>
  <dd>The portion of a modeled 3D space that is visible to the eye. A frustum has the shape of a pyramid with the sliced-off top, where the narrow portion is closest to the eye. The top and the bottom of the pyramid are called the <em>near depth</em> and the <em>far depth</em>. The viewing frustum is sometimes called the field of view.</dd>
